## Final Project Overview

My final project consist of  4 milestones and this e-portfolio.

1. Milestone - 1 Code Review
2. Milestone - 2 Enhancement One: Software Design/Engineering
3. Milestone - 3 Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure
4. Milestone - 4 Enhancement Three: Databases

## Milestone 1 (Code Review)
Within Milestone 1's folder you will find the code review in video. In Milestone 1, I will thoroughly review the code that relates to various computer science categories. You will then talk about the code's weaknesses and how to improve its efficiency. While it's important to exhibit your best thinking, this exercise should be considered an informal exercise to improve the dialogue with your instructor.

## Milestone 2 (Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering)
Within Milestone 2's folder is the Software Design and Engineering Enhancement project along with the original and enhanced code. In Milestone 2, I had to submit an updated version of your first refined artifact based on your instructor-approved enhancements. This enhanced work will illustrate my knowledge and skill in the category of software design/engineering.

## Milestone 3 (Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure)
Within Milestone 3's folder is the Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement project along with the enhanced code. In Milestone 3, I had to submit an updated version of your second refined artifact based on your instructor-approved enhancements. This enhanced work will illustrate my knowledge and skill in the category of algorithms and data structure.

## Milestone 4 (Enhancement Three: Database)
Within Milestone 4's folder is the Database Enhancement project along with the enhanced code. In Milestone 4, I had to submit an updated version of your second refined artifact based on your instructor-approved enhancements. This enhanced work will illustrate my knowledge and skill in the category of Database.

## Final report (ePortfolio and Professional Self-Assessment) 
Within the Final Report's folder you will find the the final project with polished artifact containing all of the critical elements of the final product. It
should reflect the incorporation of feedback gained throughout the course.
